## <i class="fa-regular fa-face-laugh-wink"></i> Short Bio
<!-- I am actively seeking Ph.D. positions for the Fall 2025 intake.<br> -->
I am actively seeking Ph.D. positions..<br>
Currently, I am a Research Assistant (from Spring 2023) at the Machine Intelligence Lab ([MiLAB](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/index.html)), School of Engineering, Westlake University, collaborating with [Prof. Donglin Wang(王东林)](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=-fo6wdwAAAAJ&hl) and Dr. Xiangfei Yang(杨祥飞).
## <i class="fa-brands fa-gripfire"></i> Research Interests
My research interests and experience cover the integration of Neuromorphic Computing and Machine Learning, i.e., brain-inspired algorithms and spiking neural networks(SNN), including
- **Neuromorphic Computation**<br>
For reinforcement learning, I utilize ANN-SNN hybrid training or ANN2SNN conversion strategies to optimize the balance between performance and energy-consumption of agents. Additionally, I aim to enhance the accuracy of brain-inspired algorithms in learning from different modalities, including images, text, and 3D data. This multidisciplinary approach allows for the development of more efficient and effective neuromorphic systems.
- **Event-based Vision Recognition**<br>
Improving the recognition accuracy of transformer-based networks on DVS and RGB datasets, aiming for low-latency and low-power autonomous driving.
- **VLM in Robotic Learning**<br>
Developing advanced robotic learning systems that integrate multiple sensory modalities, including vision, 3D geometric data, text to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the environment.

Additionally, I have a strong background in life science, including molecular biology, structural biology, and neuroscience. I have also collaborated with [Professor Yi Sun(孙一)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MGaoXkwAAAAJ&hl) on research exploring the mechanisms of biological neural systems using machine learning methods. I am interested in NLP for Science.
